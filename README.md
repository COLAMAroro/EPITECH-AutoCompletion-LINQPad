# EPITECH-AutoCompletion-LINQPad
Did most of my project in LINQPad. But don't copy tho, cuz you'll get a -42

The real work is in autoCompletion_selection.linq. The other one was an incomplete WIP (which was completed in the selection file)

Oh yeah, and it's a LINQPad file, not a dotnet project. Yet another reason to *NOT COPY WHAT'S INSIDE THIS REPO*
